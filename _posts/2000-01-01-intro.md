# Exploring crop diversity and evolution to drive improvement

#### My group investigates how adaptation and selection shape the genome and population structure of crop species. We work with well-designed crop diversity panels and families using bioinformatic methods. Our aim is to identify benefitial haplotypes for traits under agricultural selection and incorporate adaptation and resilience into the genetic background of elite varieties.

Plants are adapted to a broad range of environmental pressures. Cultivated plants are also subjected to strong selective forces in agricultural settings, either unconscious selection or systematic breeding. All this genetic variation provides a reservoir of adaptive and resistance alleles in traits under selection that can be used in genetic research and crop improvement. 

Natural and agricultural selection results in detectable changes in genomes and populations, such as high LD, perturbed allele frequency patterns, strong population differentiation, structural and gene variation, etc. These changes have functional consequences, sush as loss of function, in expression, copy-number variation, etc. We investigate these changes using bioinformatic methods, such as population structure analysis, whole-genome selection scanning, comparative genomics, association mapping, and transcriptomic gene expression analysis. We collaborate with gene banks, genetic researchers, and pre-breeding institutions from the UK and overseas. We also collaborate with non-academic institutions as part of our impact delivery.
