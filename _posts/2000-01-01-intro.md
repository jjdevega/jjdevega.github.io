###Crops are subjected to strong selective forces in agricultural settings, either unconscious selection or systematic breeding. My group investigates the effects of agricultural selection on the genome and population structure of crop species. Our main aim is to identify candidate germplasm and haplotypes for traits under agricultural selection to increase tolerance and resistance in elite cultivars.
